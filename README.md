# paraffin

Paraffin, derived from the Latin phrase `parum affinis` meaning
`little related`, is a Python package designed to run [DVC](https://dvc.org)
stages in parallel. While DVC does not currently support this directly, Paraffin
provides an effective workaround. For more details, refer to the DVC
documentation on
[parallel stage execution](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/repro#parallel-stage-execution).

> [!WARNING]
> `paraffin` is still very experimental.
> Do not use it for production workflows.

## Installation

Install Paraffin via pip:

```bash
pip install paraffin
```

## Usage

### paraffin submit
You can submit your current DVC workflow to a database file `paraffin.db` for later execution.

> [!TIP]
> The paraffin submit command supports globing patterns.
```bash
paraffin submit # submit all stages
paraffin submit C_AddNodeNumbers "A*" # select which stages to submit
```

### paraffin worker
A submitted job will be executed by paraffin workers.
To start a worker you can run `paraffin worker`.
The worker will pick up all the jobs in the workeres queue and close once finished.
You can specify the number of stages a worker should process in parallel by using `paraffin worker --jobs <n>`.
Alternatively, you can start more workers by running the command multiple times.

```bash
paraffin worker
```

### paraffin ui
Paraffin ships with a web application for visualizing the progress.
You can start it using
```bash
paraffin ui
```
The UI allows you to visualize the progress in real-time, restart jobs and manage workers.

## Queue Labels

To fine-tune execution, you can assign stages to specific Celery queues, allowing you to manage execution across different environments or hardware setups.
Define queues in a `paraffin.yaml` file:

```yaml
queue:
    "B_X*": BQueue
    "A_X_AddNodeNumbers": AQueue
```
Then, start a worker with specified queues, such as celery (default) and AQueue:
```bash
paraffin worker -q AQueue,default
```
All `stages` not assigned to a queue in `paraffin.yaml` will default to the `default` queue.


> [!TIP]

> our other project [ZnTrack](https://zntrack.readthedocs.io/) for a more
> Pythonic way to define workflows.
