# paraffin

Paraffin, derived from the Latin phrase `parum affinis` meaning
`little related`, is a Python package designed to run [DVC](https://dvc.org)
stages in parallel. While DVC does not currently support this directly, Paraffin
provides an effective workaround. For more details, refer to the DVC
documentation on
[parallel stage execution](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/repro#parallel-stage-execution).

> [!WARNING]
> `paraffin` is still very experimental.
> Do not use it for production workflows.

## Installation

Install Paraffin via pip:

```bash
pip install paraffin
```

## Usage

The `paraffin` command mirrors `dvc repro`, enabling you to queue and execute your entire pipeline or selected stages with parallelization.
If no parameters are specified, the entire graph will be queued and executed via `dvc repro --single-item`.

```bash
paraffin <stage name> <stage name> ... <stage name>
# Example: run with a maximum of 4 parallel jobs
celery -A paraffin.worker worker --loglevel=WARNING --concurrency=4
```

### Parallel Execution

Due to limitations in Celeryâ€™s graph handling (see [Celery discussion](https://github.com/celery/celery/discussions/9376)), complete parallelization is not always achievable. Paraffin will display parallel-ready stages in a flowchart format.
All stages are visualized in a [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) flowchart.

                B_Y_ParamsToOuts
                B_Y_ParamsToOuts_1
        end
        subgraph Level1:2
                B_X_AddNodeNumbers
                B_Y_AddNodeNumbers
        end
        subgraph Level1:3
                B_SumNodeAttributes
        end
        Level1:1 --> Level1:2
        Level1:2 --> Level1:3
```




## Queue Labels

To fine-tune execution, you can assign stages to specific Celery queues, allowing you to manage execution across different environments or hardware setups.
Define queues in a `paraffin.yaml` file:

```yaml
queue:
    "B_X*": BQueue
    "A_X_AddNodeNumbers": AQueue
```
Then, start a worker with specified queues, such as celery (default) and AQueue:
```bash
celery -A paraffin.worker worker -Q AQueue,celery
```
All `stages` not assigned to a queue in `paraffin.yaml` will default to the `celery` queue.
